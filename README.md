## Short abstract
In recent years the pursuit of original drivers and methods is becoming an increasing
requirement for migration studies, considering the new technologies used to characterise
and understand the human migration phenomenon. Many researchers have proposed to
employ non-traditional data sources to study migration trends, including so-called social
Big Data such as online social networks. This unconventional
approach is intended to find an alternative methodology to answer open questions about
the human mobility framework (i.e., nowcasting flows and stocks, studying the integration
of multiple sources and knowledge, and investigating migration drivers). 
In this context of meaningful data combination, many types of data exist, still
very scattered and heterogeneous, making integration far from straightforward.
Our work focuses on the integrated use of heterogeneous traditional datasets and new data types. We present two different contributions: a new multi-feature dataset (MIMI dataset) and a new predictive model that could significantly contribute to the study of migration drivers and to forecast emerging trends through the use of Artificial Intelligence technologies.
All in all, our contribution lie in the need for new perspectives, methods, and analyses that can no longer prescind from taking into account a variety of new factors. The heterogeneous and multidimensional sets of data released with MIMI and exploited in the two models with the aid of the BMP indicator offer a new overview of the characteristics of human migration, enabling a better understanding and potential exploration of the relationship between migration and its drivers also through non-traditional sources of data.
